# Sketchpad

---

This project will showcase the DOM manipulation skills developed
so far. <br>
<br>
The goal is to create a working, not as advanced version of an
online sketchpad, where the computer mouse will be the equivalent
of a stylus, pen, or colored pencil used to draw an image on a
specified "canvas" allotted space. Hopefully, this project will
remind people of the old Etch-A-Sketch toy for kids from the
early 2000's since that was the inspiration for the css styling.
